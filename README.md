# Specific problems

* 100 milliseconds requirement and optional requirement 1 are ignored.
* Units come after numbers so, for example, not "A. 147", it should be "147 A".
* Whatever key I press, it calculates the balance again and again. This is inefficient.
* Balance sucks, no floating point and calculation is wrong.
* Global variables (current, voltage, capacity etc) suck.
* Value increment-decrement logic is not accurate and sucks.
* Design sucks.
* Code styling sucks.


# Comment

Requirements are ignored so the code is not really trustable to use in a serious project. You should keep doing personal projects to improve yourself and pay attention to details in the requirements since requirements are everything and each details is important.


# What to do now

1. Review the code, work on it, understand it. It has small edits on your code so it is easy to understand.
2. Put the code to GitHub as private repo. Add me as developer so I can see it.
3. We gonna improve the code step by step. First thing you gonna do is converting UI part code to QML. It should take at most 1 day. Normally it takes just 10min, there is no really much work to do, you just need to learn how to do it so its fair to take 1 day.
